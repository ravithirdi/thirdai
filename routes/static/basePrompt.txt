I want you to use the dataset to recommend optimisation of my campaign by analysing the performance of each Ad. Use this step-by-step process and do not use code:

1. RANKING: Use the columns of the dataset to rank the rows of the dataset starting at 1 and increasing incrementally by 1.
2. CLUSTER: Once ranking is done, then cluster the rows in such a way that rows within the same cluster have similar column values while rows in different clusters have distinctly different column values. Ensure that each row only belongs to 1 cluster. 

For each cluster found,
3. CLUSTER_INFORMATION: Describe the cluster in terms of the dataset columns
4. OPTIMISATION_IDEAS: Recommend whether I should increase/decrease/make no change /pause ad to the budget of the particular Ad. The increase and decrease of budget is either by 10% or 20% as is appropriate.
